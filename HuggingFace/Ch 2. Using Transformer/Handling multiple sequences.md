# Handling multiple sequences

In the previous section, we explored the simplest of use cases: doing inference on a single sequence of a small length. However, some questions emerge already:

- How do we handle multiple sequences?
- How do we handle multiple sequences of different lengths?
- Are vocabulary indices the only inputs that allow a model to work well?
- Is there such a thing as too long a sequence?

Letâ€™s see what kinds of problems these questions pose, and how we can solve them using the ðŸ¤— Transformers API.

## Models expect a batch of inputs

The ðŸ¤— Transformers models expect multiple sentences by default as input.If we sent a single sequence to the model, it will throw errors. So we need to we need to add a dimension on top of a sequence for passing it to the model.


**Batching** is the act of sending multiple sentences through the model, all at once. If you only have one sentence, you can just build a batch with a single sequence.

Batching allows the model to work when you feed it multiple sentences. Using multiple sequences is just as simple as building a batch with a single sequence. 

Thereâ€™s a second issue, though. When youâ€™re trying to batch together two (or more) sentences, they might be of different lengths. If youâ€™ve ever worked with tensors before, you know that they need to be of rectangular shape, so you wonâ€™t be able to convert the list of input IDs into a tensor directly. To work around this problem, we usually pad the inputs.

## Padding the inputs

Padding makes sure all our sentences have the same length by adding a special word called the `padding token` to the sentences with fewer values. For example, if you have 10 sentences with 10 words and 1 sentence with 20 words, padding will ensure all the sentences have 20 words.

The padding token ID can be found in **tokenizer.pad_token_id**.

```
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(checkpoint)

sequence1_ids = [[200, 200, 200]]
sequence2_ids = [[200, 200]]
batched_ids = [[200, 200, 200], [200, 200, tokenizer.pad_token_id]]

print(model(torch.tensor(sequence1_ids)).logits)
print(model(torch.tensor(sequence2_ids)).logits)
print(model(torch.tensor(batched_ids)).logits)
```
```
tensor([[ 1.5694, -1.3895]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)
tensor([[ 0.5803, -0.4125]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)
tensor([[ 1.5694, -1.3895],
        [ 1.3373, -1.2163]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)

```

The key feature of Transformer models is attention layers that contextualize each token. These will take into account the padding tokens since they attend to all of the tokens of a sequence. To get the same result when passing individual sentences of different lengths through the model or when passing a batch with the same sentences and padding applied, we need to tell those attention layers to ignore the padding tokens. This is done by using an attention mask.

## Attention masks

Attention masks are tensors with the exact same shape as the input IDs tensor, filled with 0s and 1s: 1s indicate the corresponding tokens should be attended to, and 0s indicate the corresponding tokens should not be attended to (i.e., they should be ignored by the attention layers of the model).

```
batched_ids = [
    [200, 200, 200],
    [200, 200, tokenizer.pad_token_id]
]

attention_mask = [
  [1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0]
]

outputs = model(torch.tensor(batched_ids), attention_mask=torch.tensor(attention_mask))
print(outputs.logits)
```
O/P
```
tensor([[ 1.5694, -1.3895],
        [ 0.5803, -0.4125]], grad_fn=<AddmmBackward>)
```

## Longer sequences

With Transformer models, there is a limit to the lengths of the sequences we can pass the models. Most models handle sequences of up to 512 or 1024 tokens, and will crash when asked to process longer sequences. There are two solutions to this problem:
- Use a model with a longer supported sequence length.
- Truncate your sequences.

Models have different supported sequence lengths, and some specialize in handling very long sequences. Longformer is one example, and another is LED.

Use `max_sequence_length` parameter to truncate your sequences:
```
sequence = sequence[:max_sequence_length]
```
