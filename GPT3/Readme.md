# GPT3

> Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. GPT-3's full version has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters. The quality of the text generated by GPT-3 is so high that it is difficult to distinguish from that written by a human, which has both benefits and risks.[Wikipedia]
