# Text Normalization

In any natural language, words can be written or spoken in more than one form depending on the situation. That’s what makes the language such a thrilling part of our lives, right? For example:

- Lisa ate the food and washed the dishes.
- They were eating noodles at a cafe.
- Don’t you want to eat before we leave?
- We have just eaten our breakfast.
- It also eats fruit and vegetables.

In all these sentences, we can see that the word eat has been used in multiple forms. For us, it is easy to understand that eating is the activity here. So it doesn’t really matter to us whether it is ‘ate’, ‘eat’, or ‘eaten’ – we know what is going on.

Unfortunately, that is not the case with machines. They treat these words differently. Therefore, we need to normalize them to their root word, which is “eat” in our example.

Hence, **text normalization is a process of transforming a word into a single canonical form**. This can be done by two processes, `stemming` and `lemmatization`. 
Let’s understand what they are in detail.

## What are Stemming and Lemmatization?
