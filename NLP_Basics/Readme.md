# Basic NLP Algorithm theory and implementation

This repo contains all the basic techniques that are to be used in any NLP task.

It includes:
1. Data Pre-processing:
    - Removing unwanted charcacters using Regex or similar technique
         - Removing HTML tags, Unicode and other symbols, numbers, & Links  
    - [Tokenization](https://github.com/mittalsharad/NLP/tree/main/NLP_Basics/Tokenization)
    - Changing case of all words
    - [Text Normalization](https://github.com/mittalsharad/NLP/tree/main/NLP_Basics/Text%20Normalization)
        - Stemming
        - Lemmatization
    - [Stop word removal](https://github.com/mittalsharad/NLP/tree/main/NLP_Basics/Stop%20Word%20Removal)

2. Embeddings and Representations
    - 1. [Bag of Words (BOW)](https://github.com/mittalsharad/NLP/tree/main/NLP_Basics/Bag%20of%20Words)
    - 2. Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
    - 3. Word2Vec

3. Modelling Techniques
    - Classical ML Algorithms like Naive Bayes
    - State of the art models like LSTM, BERT, GPT
